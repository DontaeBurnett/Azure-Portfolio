# 01-Azure Compute and Identity Management

## Summary:
This project involves deploying a virtual machine, securing it using RBAC, applying Azure Policies for resource governance, encrypting sensitive data, and monitoring costs. It teaches foundational concepts for managing Azure identities, governance, and compute resources.

## Scenario:
A company wants to deploy a virtual machine for their web application, secure it with role-based access control, enforce a policy for naming conventions, encrypt sensitive data, and monitor the cost of the deployed resources.

## Steps:
1. **Deploy a Virtual Machine (VM)**: Set up a basic virtual machine in Azure for the web application.
2. **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Secure the VM by assigning appropriate roles to users.
3. **Apply Azure Policies**: Enforce a naming convention policy for resources.
4. **Enable Data Encryption**: Protect sensitive data by enabling encryption at rest.
5. **Monitor Costs**: Use Azure Cost Management tools to monitor and optimize the cost of deployed resources.

## Tools Used:
- Azure Virtual Machines
- Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Azure Policies
- Azure Cost Management
