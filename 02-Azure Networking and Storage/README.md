## ðŸš€ Project Tasks

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Configure a Virtual Network (VNet)

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Navigate to **Virtual Networks** > **+ Create**.
3. Select the **Subscription** and **Resource Group**.
4. Name your VNet (e.g., `MyVNet`) and select a region.
5. Add subnets (e.g., `FrontendSubnet`, `BackendSubnet`).
6. Review and create the VNet.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Create a Network Security Group (NSG)

1. Go to **Network Security Groups** > **+ Create**.
2. Fill in the NSG name and associate it with the appropriate subnet.
3. Add inbound/outbound security rules to control traffic.
4. Associate the NSG with your VNetâ€™s subnet or network interface.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Set Up Azure Storage Account

1. Navigate to **Storage accounts** > **+ Create**.
2. Choose the resource group, name your storage account, and select a region.
3. Choose the **Standard** or **Premium** performance tier.
4. Enable **Blob, File, Queue, or Table storage** based on requirements.
5. Review and create the storage account.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Upload and Access Data

1. Open the storage account and go to **Containers**.
2. Create a new container (e.g., `project2data`).
3. Upload sample files and test access using **Azure Storage Explorer** or **SAS token**.
